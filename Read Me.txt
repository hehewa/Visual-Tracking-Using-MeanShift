These files are the code made by Mohit Kumar Ahuja for Visual Tracking Lab 2
Submitted to: Dr. Desire Sidibe 

The functions made for the lab are mentioned below with a short description:

1. Mean_Shift_Tracking.m : This file contains the implimentation of Mean-Shift algorithm using "CAR" Sequence.

2. color_distribution.m : This function was made to compute the normal histogram (h) as well as the Epanechnikov profile. 
 
3. compute_bhattacharyya_coefficient: This function computes the Bhattacharyya coefficient.
 
4. compute_meanshift_vector: This function is made to compute the new center of mass and to add it to the previous one.

5. compute_weights: It computes the weights of the neighbouring pathes and finalises the target patch in new frame who has the highest weight.

6. extract_image_patch_center_size: It computes the centre of the patch.
